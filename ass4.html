                     <p> <b>When Swiss hotelier, the late Ueli Prager, founded the Mövenpick brand in 1948, he redefined the European restaurant scene and paved the way for a new style of modern hospitality, conceived on a simple premise: ‘doing normal things in an extraordinary manner’. A visionary of his time, Prager created a restaurant concept based on simplicity, innovation, commitment to service and a passion for culinary and hospitality excellence, and the rest, as they say, is history.


                    The official launch of Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts was marked by the opening of two hotels at Zurich-Airport and Zurich-Regensdorf. Expansion beyond Europe started in 1976 with the opening in Cairo of the Mövenpick Hotel Jolie Ville. Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts were among the first companies to operate hotels under management contracts, which helped allow rapid growth. Expansion continued through the 1980s into Egypt, with the chain’s first cruise ship (HS Radamis) beginning operations in 1991.

                    Alwaleed bought 27 percent of the chain in 1997, increasing that to 33 percent in 2003.

                    New expansions into Africa and the Middle East saw “pilgrim hotels” opened in Madinah in Saudi Arabia, and a period of hotel renovation and portfolio consolidation began. Rapid expansion continued through the early 2000s.

                    A strategic partnership with Green Globe was announced in 2010, beginning a drive towards sustainability with a specific focus on the travel and tourism industry across all Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts properties.

                    Certification and awards accompany further expansion into India, the Philippines, Singapore,[9] and Ghana (2011[10]). New hotels opened in China in 2013, and Pakistan in 2014, and Bangladesh in 2015.<b>
